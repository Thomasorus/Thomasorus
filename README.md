### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer specialized in interfaces, user experience and accessibility. I'm a technical generalist with experience on web projects of all sizes and all types of stacks. I have worked alone, as well as in teams of dozens of people, sometimes as a technical advisor for non-technical coworkers.

I have a strong interest in indie web, low tech and sustainable stacks. I've been producing podcasts and writing about fighting games, my main hobby, for more than ten years and have worked for professional publications and brands; as well as organized tournaments and events in non-profit organizations. I also was a French comics specialized bookseller.

I have a degree in fine arts and web development.
